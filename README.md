# MBED Galiga Game
## Overview
This is a Galaga parody I made called Galiga. It runs on the ARM Mbed, using a Nav Switch and several pushbuttons to control the game's operation. The goal of the game is to hit 5 enemies before you die. Probably should have abstracted a lot more in retrospect, especially in the main loop, but the game runs fine, and I debugged all of the errors. This github does not contain a few library files I used, for playing sound from a speaker,
accessing an SD card, and handling writing protocol to the LCD display that the game runs on.
